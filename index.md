## Interest in IT

I have always had an interest in IT since I was young. I immigrated to Australia in the late 80’s and remember the first time I played Mario Brothers on the original Nintendo (NES) and played games on our friends gaming consoles. Everything was so exciting from gaming consoles, getting our first PC where we had to load Windows every session to, dial up internet (and hiding the actual phone from my sister so we didn’t lose connection). I didn’t know it then, but I lived through the perfect time and felt as though the pace of technology matched my own life in the leaps it took forward. My brother then graduated High School and was over the moon at being accepted at Uni for a Bachelor in IT. My parents argued with him about computers not being a real career path and he should just stick to regular engineering. They are now glad they were wrong. I took my Parents recommendation for an office career and studied Business Administration but was always unfulfilled in my monotonous Finance roles and admired my brother for his decision. 

I spent my first few years working in Finance roles within Government departments at federal, state and council level. A temporary contract landed me working in the Payroll Department for Queensland Health after a much-publicised bungled system rollout. It was here I found my passion for Systems and IT and set out to learn everything I could about the misunderstood SAP System that had caused an insurmountable amount of damage. I was recognised for my efforts and was promoted to technical roles eventually reaching the Testing and Development departments. This experience led to me to my current role as an SAP System Analyst and Time and Attendance System Administrator. 

I have chosen RMIT to study and formalise my experience as I have worked with mentors and colleagues who have studied here. While the majority have studied on campus, others have spoken of the Online Learning being a comprehensive and positive experience for people like myself who also work full time. I have seen their gained knowledge be applied in the workplace and hope to upgrade my skill set in the same way. I would like to learn more about the general IT, web design and System Management and apply that knowledge to further my career. 

## Ideal Job 

[SAP Jobs](https://jobs.sap.com/job/New-York-SAP-HXM-Solution-Architect-NY-10001/783405101/)

        align="centre">

My ideal job would be SAP Solution Architect. This is position is a niche a highly influential position within SAP as a company. A Solution Architect oversees global settings for the program, creating efficiencies and upgrade management. This position is specified to the HRIS systems which means any changes made would also need to maintain compliance within the payroll system. This appeals to me as I have extensive knowledge in these environments and would be the pinnacle of my working knowledge to hold an influential role on a global scale.   

To be considered for this role, one would need over 10 years’ experience as a Solution Consultant and various implementation projects for a range of industries and their respective integration Systems. The ideal candidate would require a Bachelor of IT as well as completion of SAP acknowledged accreditations offered directly through their partner program.

I have over 10 years’ experience working with SAP and have assisted with one roll out project. I have completed part of my Success Factors accreditation that pertains to my current position but would require further training to be considered fully accredited. I would also require obtaining a Bachelor in IT which I hope to complete through RMIT. My aim is to complete my bachelor’s and seek further opportunity in other organisations looking to upgrade or migrate to SAP and gaining experience in a variety of cross functional programs. 

## Personal Profile

*Myers- Briggs Test Results*

This test result is expected as I am known for these qualities in my current role working between departments. I consider myself an extrovert of sorts and intuitive of others around me and their needs. These are great skills to have in an environment where you are required to be flexible but can be detrimental when faced with making unpopular firm decisions. 
I feel confident entering group environments, making introductions and suggestions. I like to gauge the people I work with and try and meet them and their level of participation and offer help when needed. This can also hinder me as I do find myself being a people pleaser and sometimes means I overcompensate to my own detriment. 
When working in a team, I should be considerate of people in my team who are not as interactive as myself. I should also set boundaries for myself and play to strengths in knowledge and not over burden myself for the sake of being diplomatic. 

*Online Learning Style Test*

        align="centre">

The Online Learning Style Test results were not a complete surprise to me as I’ve always known to learn best when listening at my own pace. I usually take my own notes down and review them by reading back to myself to hear if this makes sense to me. I enjoy studying with music playing in my headphones as this helps me to focus. 
Others in my team will most likely have differing learning styles to mine where they may not take as many notes. I can assist by sharing my own notes and discussing their findings. 
This is a good learning style to have when in a group setting where you can have dialogue back and forth. I like to speak to others and talk through the main points made to see if I captured the meaning. 

*Open Source Psychometric Test*

        align="centre">

As per the previous two tests, these results do not surprise me as they mirror the 16 Personalities test. I scored highly in the agreeableness scale as well as the extroversion. This points to being highly optimistic and extroverted. While I don’t think of myself as so highly extroverted, I do agree I am an optimistic person. 
 As with the previous test, I have no issues being in team settings and voicing my opinions. I also encourage everyone to participate and try and motivate others to do so. I will be mindful of that this could also clash with others and be respectful of this. 
I will try and keep up morale in others when things aren’t going well. I think keeping an open mind and positive attitude during challenging times is what build resilience to find solutions as a team. 

## Project Idea 

*Overview*

When thinking of something as a Project idea, I first thought of maybe exploring something that would be popular and accessible to masses. But then I had a lightbulb moment while at my own job. Everyone who works is subject to Award or contracting conditions in Australia, these are governed at federal and state level for various conditions. Currently, there is only one site which is recommended nationwide to hold all these Awards, which is the Fairwork website. However, this is still not as comprehensive for EBA amendments or individual leave types which are governed at state level such as Long Service Leave. My project idea would a multiplatform solution which would bring all these sources together that can also be used as a plug in to existing systems as a source of information. 

*Motivation*

In my line of work, I have come across a wide range of people of who are ultra-diligent as to what their work entitlements. And the others who are unaware of what their Award conditions are and what they cover. A problem which we have seen multiples times are the damning headlines of “Multinational company owe staff Millions of underpaid wages”.  Most of the times followed by an admission of guilt and blaming a software glitch for an issue a Junior Accountant could find on Audit. Unfortunately, the people usually affected by these issues are on the lower tax brackets who cannot afford to miss out on penalties owed to them. Others who are unaware of their rights and conditions may be hesitant to raise issues when they have been underpaid. Information is power and this empower employees to help themselves. 

*Description*

This solution would require a multi-platform approach to successfully capture all of the information in consensus. Firstly, the website would be the “one stop shop” with all links to each Award, EBA and amendments. The website would also include the information for each leave type, use and condition categorised by state and industry. It would contain information breakdown by industry and state with the original sources published on site, not links to other departmental advice. There would be a bot for FAQ’s and prompt scenarios for recommendations. These would be better than just a this could triage basic issues rather than misinformation on a search function. There would be a page where could filter through an assortment of keywords to raise specific issues. This function would then direct you to a page where it would prefill a form to raise any serious issues to the appropriate office and raise a ticket. The website would also have a tab for employers to be able to access the latest amendments and alerts over things such as pay increases and Tax and Super changes. The accompanying app would allow for a quicker version of the same information available on the website. This would compromise for a QR code reader which can redirect employees to specific scenarios. For example, if there was a recent amendment to an EBA, the union or Employee services can publicise these changes via posters in workplaces for employees and include the QR code so the employee can see how the change apply to their specific industry. The tool would also be able to be available as a plug-in component to their individual payroll and time and attendance system. This would be an additional reference for Employers to use in running Award comparisons for mid-year increase, tax bracket changes and super changes to be applied broadly. A challenge I have found personally, especially over the past two years, is that the Employment conditions can vary dramatically depending on the political needs. The pandemic highlighted this with the introduction of Jobkeeper which had to be implemented in a single pay cycle. This plug in would alert employers to upcoming changes and would reference suggestions as to how payments will need to be reported. Identify tax and super implications as well as eligibility for individual employees. Currently this relies on individual organisations to reference this information for themselves, often the communication is dispersed by the software provider and open to the individual interpretation. This referencing tool would ensure all changes made are interpreted according to their intended legislation. There would be a reporting function which would be compatible to their current business rules and show as is and to be conditions. This would also allow for templates such as tax scales to be available in a flat file format to be uploaded when needed. In this scenario, the plug in would be available on a Test environment where the changes could be recommended and implemented in test before being rolled over to production, ensuring any bugs don’t affect production outcome. The plug in would also be compatible with current Single Touch Payroll requirements from the ATO and read wage types to be transmitted in the current reporting format. 

*Tools and Technologies* 

A project of this size would require a comprehensive website built to incorporate the large volumes of information needed. There would need to be a registered domain name that would differentiate it to the current Fairwork website, ensuring that the public know this is not a government site. This website would need to be compatible with Windows and MAC users and could be built using Wordpress. The accompanying app would need to be created for ease of use for both Apple and Android users and can be built using programs such as Appy pie and can be a conduit to the website to allow for memory saving. The plug-in component would need to be configured in consultation with existing Payroll software providers and their subsequent STP set up. This could be offered in inline with the current quarterly upgrade references. Limiting this plug-in reference to the test environment. 

*Skills Required*

This would need to be widely consulted and verified project as this is a source of truth for industry and employees. The project would require buy in for the different government agencies to share and store this information from the various sources. The website would require a team to build and maintain. Most importantly, there would need to be a strong legal and team required to ensure all the information published and updated is correct and being interpreted in an accurate manner. The strength of this project lies in the reliability of this being an accurate source of information, so this component would be the most involved and important. 

*Outcome*

The success of this project would restore confidence in Employees and Employers for their pay systems and Award interpretation. This would be an added component for Employers to ensure they are reducing their risk by having the most up to date information already attached to their pay systems. By having an up-to-date award interpreter, organisations can have confidence in their reporting and audits results would reflect the efficiencies. For individual employees, this tool would empower them to seek the information and apply their own circumstances. It would greatly reduce incidents of wage theft for vulnerable employees and return the power back to the individual. Although I have limited knowledge of how this could be executed, I believe the concept to be important and would benefit millions of people.
